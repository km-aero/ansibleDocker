# Docker AMI

I use ansible to create and provision docker on an AWS AMI.

I use --private_key <PRIVATE_KEY_DIRECTORY>

There are separation of tasks as unique roles which can be run separately if needed

Purpose for this is to be used as a base to boot up more than one instance for docker swarm mode.
